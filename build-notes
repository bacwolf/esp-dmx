Random notes for building this

To convert binary stuff into c constats I use xxd:
 
    xxd --include dmx512.png > dmx512.h

Some some minor manual massaging is still required.
The definition must read:

    const char PROGMEM dmx512_png[] = {

I also add the content type as variable to the same file.

    const char PROGMEM dmx512_png_ctype[] = "image/png";
