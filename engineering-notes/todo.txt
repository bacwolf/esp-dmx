Issues:

- Webinterface unsesposive when processing artnet frames

Todo:

- Improve update webinterface
  - Display progress page immediately after pressing Update button
    Seems pretty impossible, must implement in Javascript
- Make poweronshow configurable, (number of channels, start channel)
- Make update-URL configurable
- Show MAC address in webinterface
- Online-Update: Get filename from txt file
- Online-Update: Make ssl work

Done:
- Allow parameter reset and wifi reset separately
- Temperature sensor
- Temperature dependent fan-control
- Lower status LED brightness
- Set LED to red when updating
- Changed to library ArtnetnodeWifi to get pollreply
- Added reset to defaults config page, allows also to change Wifi on next boot
