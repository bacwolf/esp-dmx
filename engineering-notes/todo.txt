Issues:

- Webinterface unsesposive when processing artnet frames

Todo:

- Temperature sensor
- Temperature dependent fan-control
- Improve update webinterface
  - Display progress page immediately after pressing Update button
    Seems pretty impossible, must implement in Javascript

Done:
- Lower status LED brightness
- Set LED to red when updating
- Changed to library ArtnetnodeWifi to get pollreply
- Added reset to defaults config page, allows also to change Wifi on next boot
