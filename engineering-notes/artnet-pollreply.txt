2 OpCode Int16 - OpPollReply Transmitted low byte first.
3 IP Address[4] Int8 - Array containing the Node’s IP address. First array entry
  is most significant byte of address. When binding is implemented, bound nodes may

4 Port Int16 - The Port is always 0x1936 Transmitted low byte first.
5 VersInfoH Int8 - High byte of Node’s firmware revision number. The Controller should
  only use this field to decide if a firmware update should proceed. The convention is
  that a higher number is a more recent release of firmware.
6 VersInfoL Int8 - Low byte of Node’s firmware revisionnumber.
7 NetSwitch Int8 - Bits 14-8 of the 15 bit Port-Address are encoded into the bottom 7 bits of this field.
  This is used in combination with SubSwitch and SwIn[] or SwOut[] to produce the full universe address.

   bytes representing the manufacturer initials.
14 EstaManHi Int8 - Hi byte of above
15 ShortName [18] Int8 - The array represents a null terminated short
   name for the Node. The Controller uses the ArtAddress packet to program this string.
   Max length is 17 characters plus the null. This is a fixed length field, although the
   string it contains can be shorter than the field.
16 LongName [64] Int8 - The array represents a null terminated long
   name for the Node. The Controller uses the ArtAddress packet to program this string.
   Max length is 63 characters plus the null. This is a fixed length field, although the
   string it contains can be shorter than the field.
17 NodeReport [64] Int8 - The array is a textual report of the Node’s
   operating status or operational errors. It is primarily intended for ‘engineering’ data 
   rather than ‘end user’ data. The field is
   formatted as: “#xxxx [yyyy..] zzzzz…” xxxx is a hex status code as defined in Table 3.
   yyyy is a decimal counter that increments every time the Node sends an ArtPollResponse.
   This allows the controller to monitor event changes in the Node.
   zzzz is an English text string defining the status.
   This is a fixed length field, although the string it contains can be shorter than the field.
18 NumPortsHi Int8 - The high byte of the word describing the number of input or output ports. The high
   byte is for future expansion and is currently zero.
19 NumPortsLo Int8 - The low byte of the word describing the number of input or output ports. If number
   of inputs is not equal to number of outputs, the largest value is taken. Zero is a legal
   value if no input or output ports are implemented. The maximum value is 4.
   Nodes can ignore this field as the information is implicit in PortTypes[].
20 PortTypes [4] Int8 - This array defines the operation and protocol of each channel. (A product with 4
   inputs and 4 outputs would report 0xc0,0xc0, 0xc0, 0xc0). The array length is fixed,
   independent of the number of inputs or outputs physically available on the Node.
   7 Set is this channel can output data from the Art-Net Network.

   data. Set to 01 when video is showing ethernet data. The field is now deprecated
26 SwMacro Int8 - If the Node supports macro key inputs, this
   byte represents the trigger values. The Node is responsible for ‘debouncing’ inputs. When
   the ArtPollReply is set to transmit automatically, (TalkToMe Bit 1), the
   ArtPollReply will be sent on both key down and key up events. However, the Controller
   should not assume that only one bit position has changed.

   6 Set – Macro 7 active.
   5 Set – Macro 6 active.

   When the ArtPollReply is set to transmit automatically, (TalkToMe Bit 1), the
   ArtPollReply will be sent on both key down and key up events. However, the Controller
   should not assume that only one bit position has changed.
