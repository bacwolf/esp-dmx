Objective: Measure ambient temperature between 0°C to 100°C
           using the Wemos D1 analog port


- The D1 analog port has an impedance of 320k to ground
- The NTC is connected to the 3v3 supply

Calculation with a 100k NTC (TTC05104)

Resistance:  0°C 350k   ->  492mV
            25°C 100k   ->  785mV
            60°C  20k   ->  970mV
           100°C   4.5k -> 1019mV
